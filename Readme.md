# How to: Bind a GridControl to InfiniteAsyncSource

<p>The <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/Win10Apps/400312/controls/data-grid/asynchronous-virtual-source">InfiniteAsyncSource</a> is an asynchronous virtual source that allows you to bind the GridControl] to any data source even if the total record count is unknown. You can create solutions that remain responsive to end-user actions regardless of the demands placed upon the Grid. Whenever you work with a large dataset, InfiniteAsyncSource fetches and processes data on-demand, in a background thread. This ensures that the Grid does not freeze during data-intensive operations.</p>
